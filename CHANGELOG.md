# Code Connect v1.2.2 (5th November 2024)

## Features

### General
- Added support to create Custom parsers. Those allow users to add support for languages which aren't natively supported by Code Connect. Check the [documentation](https://github.com/figma/code-connect/blob/main/docs/custom.md) for more details.

## Fixed

### React
- Only show AI question for React
- Fix error in autolinking in reduce function

# Code Connect v1.2.1 (23rd October 2024)

### General
- Added a `--exit-on-unreadable-files` flag to all commands to exit if any Code Connect files cannot be parsed. We recommend using this option for CI/CD.

## Fixed

### React
- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.2.0 where `nestedProps` referencing a hidden layer would result in an error rendering Code Connect

### SwiftUI
- Fixed potential "index is out of bounds" error.

### General
- Changed how the extension makes HTTP requests to resolve issues when connecting through a proxy. Please [submit a support ticket](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001744374) if you continue to have connection issues after this update.

### Compose

- Fixed some parsing errors when running the `create` and `publish` commands

# Code Connect v1.2.0

## Features

### General
- The interactive setup now offers AI support for accurate prop mapping between Figma and code components. Users will now be given the option to use AI during the setup process, which if chosen will assist in creating Code Connect files and attempting to accurately map your code to Figma properties.

  Data is used only for mapping and is not stored or used for training. To learn more, visit https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/23920389749655-Code-Connect

### React
- Added support for returning strings or React components from the `example` function, in addition to JSX
- Added `getProps` on `figma.instance()` which can be used to access props of a nested connected component
- Added `render` on `figma.instance()` which can be used to render a nested connected component dynamically
- Added support for including any custom props in the `props` object, that can be accessed with `getProps` in a parent component

## Fixed

### HTML
- Case of attribute names is now preserved to support Angular (fixes https://github.com/figma/code-connect/issues/172)
- Fixed a bug with `nestedProps` (fixes https://github.com/figma/code-connect/issues/176)

## Fixed

- Support mapping from an enum value to a boolean prop in CLI Assistant

## Features

### Compose
- The dependencies required to author Code Connect files now live in a separate module from the plugin and are hosted on Maven Central. Refer to the [documentation](docs/compose.md) for updated instructions on adding Code Connect to your project.

## Features

### React

  HTML support for Code Connect is in preview, and the API is liable to change during this period. Please let us know your feedback via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/figma/code-connect/issues/new/choose).

### SwiftUI
- Added a `swiftPackagePath` configuration option to specify a custom path to a `Package.swift` file to run Code Connect from.

### React
- Code Connect files created in the CLI assistant will now start including some auto-generated prop mappings between Figma properties and linked code props. This is an early feature and support for different prop types is limited.

## Fixed

### React
- `figma.nestedProps` can now be used in conjunction with `figma.boolean` for conditionally hidden nested instances (fixes https://github.com/figma/code-connect/issues/118, https://github.com/figma/code-connect/issues/89)

# Code Connect v1.0.1 (20th June 2024)

## Fixed

### General
- The automatic update check introduced in v1.0.0 did not show the correct update command for React users with the `@figma/code-connect` package installed locally â€“ it always showed the command for globally updating the package.

  We now show both `npm install @figma/code-connect@latest` and `npm install -g @figma/code-connect@latest` as options. React users with the package installed locally should use `npm install @figma/code-connect@latest`, and users of other targets (or with the package installed globally) should use `npm install -g @figma/code-connect@latest`.

  We have temporarily removed the `update` command added in v1.0.0.

# Code Connect v1.0.0 (19th June 2024)

## Features

### General
- Added [documentUrlSubstitutions](README.md#documenturlsubstitutions) config option

### Jetpack Compose
- Added support for Android Jetpack Compose. See the [README](compose/README.md) to get started

### React
- Interactive setup flow, launched by running `figma connect`, which guides you through the setup process and auto-connects your components

## Fixed

### General
- Automatic config migration (added in v0.2.0) now correctly preserves `include`/`exclude` config options
- Icon script helpers moved to a named export so they can be imported correctly (see [README](cli/scripts/README.md))

### React
- Nested helpers within `figma.nestedProps` now work as expected
- Props can now be rendered in nested object props

### SwiftUI
- `create` now outputs Swift files with the correct syntax

# Code Connect v0.2.1 (17th June 2024)

## Fixed

### React
- Fixed a bug in v0.2.0 where source paths for components could be incorrect
- Fixed a bug in v0.2.0 where Code Connect files using the new prop types failed to validate

### SwiftUI
- Fixed parsing of Code Connect files using `@FigmaChildren` annotations

# Code Connect v0.2.0 (14th June 2024)

## Breaking changes

- Code Connect now uses a single CLI tool for all supported targets. This ensures consistency and feature parity, and provides the foundations for our upcoming Android Compose and extensibility support.

  For Code Connect Swift users, you should follow the updated [CLI installation instructions](README.md#cli-installation) to install the new CLI version, and update your Code Connect Swift package to `v0.2.0` by following the [Swift installation instructions](swiftui/README.md#installation).

  For Code Connect React users, no change to installation is necessary, and you can simply update the npm dependency to `v0.2.0`.

  If you have a Code Connect configuration file, you will need to ensure it is located in your React or SwiftUI project root (e.g. alongside your `package.json` or `.xcodeproj` file), and you will need to update it to remove the top level `react` or `swiftui` key. The Code Connect CLI will offer to update your config file for you, but in unusual cases a manual migration may be necessary. This allows us to simplify configuration going forward, as each target now has its own configuration file, situated in the project root.

  Please let us know via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/figma/code-connect/issues) if you encounter any problems.
